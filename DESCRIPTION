Description: Computes the probability density and cumulative distribution functions of fourteen distributions used for the probabilistic hazard assessment. Estimates the model parameters of the distributions using the maximum likelihood and reports the goodness-of-fit statistics. The recurrence interval estimations of earthquakes are computed for each distribution.
